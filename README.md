# Cartograph: HTTP Proxy for Internet Mapping

## Introduction

Cartograph is an advanced proxy that maps HTTP networks. It is designed to aid in cybersecurity assessments and research
through high performance data collection and visualization of web ecosystems.

## Web Demo

Experience Cartograph's capabilities firsthand by exploring the following web ecosystems, presented in an interactive
visual interface (*best viewed on a desktop web browser*):

- NFL web ecosystem: [https://demo.proxyproducts.com/nfl](https://demo.proxyproducts.com/nfl)
- Twitch.tv web ecosystem: [https://demo.proxyproducts.com/twitch](https://demo.proxyproducts.com/twitch)
- Warner Media web ecosystem: [https://demo.proxyproducts.com/warnermedia](https://demo.proxyproducts.com/warnermedia)

These interactive demonstrations give you an intuitive view of Cartograph's mapping capabilities, but it is just a small
peek into the type of data that Cartograph captures.
