## Instructions for AI Agents

1. **Before starting work**: Update "Current Status" and "Current Phase"
2. **After each task**: 
   - Mark task as complete: `- [x] Task X.Y: Description`
   - Update the timestamp at the top
   - Add any relevant notes or observations
3. **If task fails**: 
   - Mark with `❌` and describe the problem in "Issues Encountered"
   - Do not proceed to next task until issue is resolved
4. **When phase complete**: 
   - Update phase status to `✅ Complete` 
   - Update overall progress counter
5. **Context management**: 
   - Always read this file before starting work to understand current state
   - Use this file to maintain context across different AI agent sessions
